# Brainstroke Prediction
This is a website for stroke prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm. 

## Dependencies
- Python 
- Pandas 
- Numpy
- Matplotlib 
- Scikit-Learn
- Imbalanced-Learn 


## Dataset
Dataset can be downloaded from the [Kaggle stroke dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

## Files
STROKE_PREDICTION.ipynb : Here you will find all code needed to run stroke predictions. In the .ipynb notebook are the model and the exploratory analysis on my dataset used to make decisions on my model.

index.html and output.html: These are the html files needed to run the app.

app.py: This folder is the flask code used to connect the front end with the back end and display a prediction based on the model.
